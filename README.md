# STUDENT-RECORD-ANALYSIS
Analyzed a student dataset to gain insights into the relationship between students' backgrounds and their future job scope

Perfect 👍 thanks for sharing the project spec screenshot. I’ll generate a **README.md** file draft for your GitHub repo based on the details provided.

## 📌 Background

Resumes form the first impression on jobs/internships recruiters. Around **70% of resumes get rejected in the initial screening**. This project aims to analyze student interns’ data to gain insights into the relationship between their **academic performance, event participation, and career aspects**.
